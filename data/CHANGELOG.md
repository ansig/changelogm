# API Changelog

This is an **example** of a changelog that are used in the *tests*.

The following headers can be used (one for each type of change):

- `Added` - for new features
- `Changed` - for changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated`- for soon-to-be removed functionality
- `Removed` - for now removed functionality
- `Fixed`- for any bug fixes
- `Security` - in case of vulnerabilities

I am adding another row here in the introduction
just to verify that paragraphs with multiple rows look ok.
